# CONTRIBUTING

## Releasing a new version

1.  Create a new changelog entry for your version in `CHANGELOG.md`
2.  Commit your change
3.  Create a Git tag with your version number
4.  Push your new commit and Git tag to GitHub

GitHub Actions will then build and release a new version of the CLI tool for you.
